# Challenge

We need the help of statistically smart people to get around SO's undocumented voting fraud script.

Proposal:

- pick one user user active (not yourself) in some popular tag
- double his reputation on the active tag, without increasing the reputation of any other individual user on that tag by more than 1.5. We will need of course to upvote other users to camouflage our fraud from the fraud detection script.
- do that with 20 puppets in under 6 months

We could start with a 1000 rep user with at least 25 answers.

I may provide the puppets and make sure that the script is running properly within my time availability if enough interest is generated.

We will not disclose the chosen target user of course.

If this works, we can then get more ambitious try to do something similar with a 10k user.
