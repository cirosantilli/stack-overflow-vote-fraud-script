# Motivation

The current reputation system is too simplistic.

The anti-fraud feels too manual and ignores [Kerckhoffs's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs's_principle).

Throttling measures like 30 votes per day and API limitations are just a cheap workaround for a robust algorithm.

This script levels the playing field, so that data scientists can focus on statistical attacks to audit the system, and forget about the silly complexities required to apply the attack.

Let's force them to move to a more robust algorithm, e.g. PageRank <http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/28874/applying-pagerank-like-algorithm-to-stack-overflow-votes>
